    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Google Colab?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Google Colab** (Colaboratory) is a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment hosted by Google. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Free GPU/TPU access** for computationally intensive tasks\n",
    "- **Zero setup** \u2014 runs entirely in your browser, no installation needed\n",
    "- **Google Drive integration** \u2014 save, share, and collaborate on notebooks seamlessly\n",
    "- **Pre-installed libraries** \u2014 pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and more are ready to use\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Is Gemini in Colab?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gemini** is Google's AI assistant built directly into Google Colab. Unlike Codex (which is a separate tool), Gemini lives *inside* the notebook environment where you're already writing code. It can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generate code cells** from natural language descriptions\n",
    "- **Explain existing code** \u2014 highlight a cell and ask \"what does this do?\"\n",
    "- **Debug errors** \u2014 when a cell throws an error, Gemini can diagnose and fix it\n",
    "- **Autocomplete code** \u2014 suggests completions as you type (like GitHub Copilot)\n",
    "- **Chat in a side panel** \u2014 ask questions without leaving your notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Google Colab + Gemini?\n",
    "\n",
    "For students and institutional researchers, Colab + Gemini offers a compelling combination:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Free tier available** \u2014 no subscription required for basic use\n",
    "2. **Familiar notebook interface** \u2014 if you've used Jupyter, you know Colab\n",
    "3. **AI is embedded** \u2014 no context switching between tools\n",
    "4. **Shareable** \u2014 share notebooks like Google Docs with colleagues\n",
    "5. **Institutional friendly** \u2014 many universities already use Google Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up and navigate Google Colab for data science workflows\n",
    "2. Use Gemini to generate, explain, and debug code inside Colab\n",
    "3. Apply the vibecoding workflow (prompt \u2192 review \u2192 iterate \u2192 validate) in Colab\n",
    "4. Practice building ML models using Gemini-assisted coding"
