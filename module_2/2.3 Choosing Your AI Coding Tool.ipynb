    "\n",
    "### Codex \u2014 Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lowest barrier to entry**: Describe what you want in plain English; no code knowledge needed to start\n",
    "2. **End-to-end automation**: Codex handles the entire pipeline \u2014 data loading, preprocessing, modeling, visualization \u2014 in one go\n",
    "3. **Great for exploration**: Quick to prototype (\"try 5 different models and compare them\")\n",
    "4. **Handles complexity**: Can orchestrate multi-step analyses from a single prompt\n",
    "5. **Natural language iteration**: \"Now add cross-validation\" or \"Make the chart bigger and use red for the baseline\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Codex \u2014 Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Black box risk**: Code runs behind the scenes \u2014 you may not understand what it did\n",
    "2. **Less control**: Hard to make precise, small edits to specific lines of code\n",
    "3. **No persistent workspace**: Each conversation starts fresh; no long-running sessions\n",
    "4. **Data privacy concerns**: Your data is uploaded to OpenAI's servers\n",
    "5. **No GPU**: Cannot accelerate computationally intensive models\n",
    "6. **Not a notebook**: Results live in a chat thread, not a reproducible .ipynb file\n",
    "7. **Subscription cost**: Full functionality requires ChatGPT Plus or Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colab + Gemini \u2014 Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Full code control**: You see, edit, and own every line of code\n",
    "2. **Reproducibility**: Notebooks are the standard format for data science; easy to re-run, share, and version\n",
    "3. **Free GPU/TPU**: Accelerate XGBoost, neural networks, and large datasets at no cost\n",
    "4. **Google Drive integration**: Seamless file management and team sharing\n",
    "5. **Institutional alignment**: Many universities already provide Google Workspace\n",
    "6. **Learning-friendly**: Seeing the code helps you learn Python and scikit-learn, not just get results\n",
    "7. **Gemini is embedded**: No context switching \u2014 AI help is right in the notebook\n",
    "8. **Free tier is generous**: Basic Colab + Gemini costs nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colab + Gemini \u2014 Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Requires some code literacy**: You need to understand Python basics to evaluate and edit Gemini's suggestions\n",
    "2. **More manual work**: You assemble the analysis cell by cell (Gemini helps but doesn't do everything)\n",
    "3. **Session timeouts**: Free Colab disconnects after ~90 minutes of inactivity\n",
    "4. **Gemini can be less capable**: For complex multi-step reasoning, Codex (GPT-4-class) may produce better results\n",
    "5. **Package reinstalls**: Non-default packages must be reinstalled each session"
